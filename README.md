# Hangman_Challenge
I have created the hangman game using dictonary for data collection, to access the words as keys and their corresponding hints as the value. 
I mainly focused on using dictonary and accessing keys and their corresponding values for hints.
This dictonary approach has a better time complexity for word look-up and hint retrival, making it more efficient for these operations compared to the list approach.

*Hope you have fun playing this game!* :-)
